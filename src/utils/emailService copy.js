          <h1>Welcome to the JP Miles Art Fam!</h1>
          <p>Hey there, [Name]! Thanks for joining my creative community. I'm JP, your friendly neighborhood abstract photography artist, and I'm stoked to have you on board. ðŸ™Œ</p>
          
          <p>By signing up, you've unlocked some seriously cool perks. You can save your favorite pieces, curate your own galleries, and <span class="highlight">track the provenance (fancy word for ownership history) of any artworks you collect</span>. Provenance is a major factor in determining an artwork's value, so let's work together to keep those records squeaky clean.</p>

          <p>Transparency is kind of my thing in the art world. While my sales history may be a blank canvas for now (hey, Rome wasn't built in a day!), I'm all about keeping things out in the open. <span class="highlight">Artwork sales and pricing? Public knowledge, baby!</span></p>

          <p>Speaking of pricing, let me lay it out for you: For every $1 earned, 1/3 goes to production costs, 1/3 to yours truly (gotta keep the brushes stocked, ya know?), and 1/3 to <span class="highlight">charity:water</span>, an organization providing clean water to communities in need. It's my way of using art to make a positive impact.</p>

          <p>I'm also a firm believer in Artist's Resale Rights (ARR), which means artists get a cut when their work is resold down the line. ARR isn't legally required in Canada (yet), but I'm offering a voluntary 15% on any resale profits, with half going to charity and half to me. You can adjust that percentage as you see fit, but let's be real â€“ the odds of my artwork skyrocketing in value are slimmer than a toothpick. Still, it's a symbolic gesture that aligns with my philosophy of giving back.</p>

          <p>I'm not your typical artist, and I like to shake things up a bit. While some things need to stay hush-hush, <span class="highlight">I believe in transparency and sharing my artistic journey with you</span>. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be celebrating your incredible eye for spotting undervalued talent (wink, wink).</p>

          <p>Alright, that's enough rambling from me. Stay tuned for more updates, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat art.</p>

          <p>Let's create something extraordinary together!</p>
          <p>- JP</p>
